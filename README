AuthLogicUserSessionHelper
==========================

Bunch of convenience methods for use with AuthLogic and Rails.

Only works if you are using a standard user, and user_session.

Would be nice if the methods were dynamically created
based on a config option.


Example
=======

[Get the current_user from the session]
  current_user

[Is there a user logged in?]
  user?

[Is there no user currently logged in?]
  no_user?

[A user is required! (use as before filter to redirect to '/login')]
  user_required

[A user cannot be logged in (will redirect to the root_url, whatever that is mapped to)]
  no_user_required

[If you need to remember what the user was trying to do before you made them login]
  store_location
  redirect_back_or_default

[user_required will store the requested location before redirecting.]
[Call redirect_back_or_default after login to enable this behaviour.]


Testing
=======

Adds login_as and logout methods to tests.
