= AuthLogic UserSession Helper

Bunch of convenience methods for use with AuthLogic and Rails.

Only works if you are using a standard user, and user_session.

Will be able to specify the model(s) names in the future

== Install

      gem install auth_logic_user_session_helper
      
      (or use bundler)

== Example


* Get the current_user from the session
      current_user

* Is there a user logged in?
      user?

* Is there no user currently logged in?
      no_user?

* A user is required! (use as before filter to redirect to '/login')
      user_required

* A user cannot be logged in (will redirect to the root_url, whatever that is mapped to)
      no_user_required

* If you need to remember what the user was trying to do before you made them login
    store_location
    redirect_back_or_default

=== user_required will store the requested location before redirecting.
=== Call redirect_back_or_default after login to enable this behaviour.


== Testing

Adds login_as and logout methods to tests.
